# Git & GitHub

## Git

Git is free and open-source version control system. It help developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects and reverts to previous versions if needed.

## Key Features of Git

- **Version Control**: Git allows you to track changes in your code over time, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows you to create branches for different features or bug fixes, making it easy to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. You can merge these branches back into the main codebase when they are complete.
- **Collaboration**: Git makes it easy to collaborate with other developers by allowing you to share your code and track changes made by others.
- **Distributed**: Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that every developer has a complete copy of the code repository on their local machine. This allows for offline work and makes it easy to collaborate with others.
- **Staging Area**: Git has a staging area that allows you to review changes before committing them to the repository. This helps you avoid committing unwanted changes.
- **History**: Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to the codebase, allowing you to see who made changes, when they were made, and what changes were made.
- **Tags**: Git allows you to create tags for specific points in the codebase, making it easy to reference important versions of your code.
- **Hooks**: Git allows you to create hooks that can be triggered by certain events, such as committing code or pushing changes. This allows you to automate tasks and enforce coding standards.

## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories and offers additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools.

GitHub is widely used by developers to host and share their code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects. It also provides a platform for developers to showcase their work and build a portfolio.

## Git Commands

### Basic Commands

- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.
- `git status`: Check the status of your local repository, including untracked files and changes to be committed.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes to a file for commit.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push committed changes to the remote repository.
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
